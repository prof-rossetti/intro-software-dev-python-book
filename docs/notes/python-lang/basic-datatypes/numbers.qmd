# Numbers


Congratulations, you are already probably familiar with numbers!


## Characteristics

In Python, there are two kinds of [numbers](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex): **integers** and **floats**. Integers are whole numbers without a decimal component, while floats have decimal component (even if it is X.0):


```{python}
x = 2
print(type(x))
print(x)
```

```{python}
x = 4.5
print(type(x))
print(x)
```

```{python}
x = 2 / 3
print(type(x))
print(x)
```

```{python}
x = 2.0
print(type(x))
print(x)
```

When dealing with large numbers, it may be helpful to visually separate using underscores. These variants are treated as if the underscores were not there:


```{python}
x = 120_000
print(type(x))
print(x)
```


```{python}
x = 120_000.0
print(type(x))
print(x)
```




## Operations

### Arithmetic Operations

It is no surprise, we can use Python as a glorified calculator, to perform arithmetic operations:


```{python}
print(2 + 10)
print(2 - 10)
print(2 * 10)
print(2 / 10)
```

### Rounding

It is possible to round numbers using the [`round` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round):

```{python}
print(round(6.675555, 0))
print(round(6.675555, 1))
print(round(6.675555, 2))
print(round(6.675555, 3))
print(round(6.675555, 4))
print(round(6.675555, 5))
```
