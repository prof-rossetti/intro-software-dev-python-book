# Error Handling

Sometimes our programs will encounter [errors](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html).

## Handling Errors

In Python, we can use a `try... except` block to handle these errors.

After running into an error for the first time, we should observe what [type of error](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#bltin-exceptions) we are experiencing (e.g. `KeyError`, `IndexError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, etc.).

Once we know what type of error we need to handle, we should wrap the problematic code inside the `try` clause, and specify the known error type in the `except` clause:

```{python}
print("TOP")

try:
    empty_list = []
    matching_item = empty_list[0] # triggers IndexError (list index out of range)
    print("EVERYTHING IS GOING FINE") # NEVER REACHED
except IndexError:
    print("OOPS - AN ERROR")

print("BOTTOM")
```

```{python}
print("TOP")

try:
    100 / 0 # triggers a ZeroDivisionError
    print("EVERYTHING IS GOING FINE") # NEVER REACHED
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("OOPS - AN ERROR")

print("BOTTOM")
```

If we're not yet sure what type of error we're experiencing, we can temporarily catch all error classes that inherit from the base error class (`Exception`), and once caught, we print the specific error's datatype to learn how to handle it:

```python
try:
    do_something() # some hypothetical problematic code
except Exception as err:
    print(type(err)) #> this will tell you the error type
    print(err) #> the error message
```

## Raising Errors

If we find the need to trigger our own errors to stop program execution (less common), we can use the `raise` keyword followed by the [type of error](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html) (e.g. `ValueError`):

```python
options = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]

choice = "hoya" # input("Please choose either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors': ")

if choice not in options:
    raise ValueError("OOPS - Please type 'rock', or 'paper', or 'scissors'.")
```

### Defining and Raising Custom Errors

We can define our own errors if that's helpful, by inheriting a class from the base `Exception` class (or preferably a more specific one):

```python
class MyCustomError(Exception):
   pass

raise MyCustomError("My custom message")
```

## Common Errors and Explanations

### Syntax Error

A `SyntaxError` occurs when the code is not written correctly according to the rules of the Python language. This can happen due to missing colons, parentheses, or incorrect indentation.

Example:
```python
# Missing colon
if True
    print("This will cause a SyntaxError")
```

### Value Error

A `ValueError` occurs when a function receives an argument of the correct type but an inappropriate value. This can happen when trying to convert a string to an integer, but the string does not represent a number.

Example:
```python
# Trying to convert a non-numeric string to an integer
int("hello")  # This will cause a ValueError
```

### Key Error

A `KeyError` occurs when trying to access a dictionary with a key that does not exist. This can happen when trying to retrieve a value from a dictionary using a key that is not present.

Example:
```python
# Accessing a non-existent key in a dictionary
my_dict = {"name": "Alice"}
print(my_dict["age"])  # This will cause a KeyError
```

### Index Error

An `IndexError` occurs when trying to access an index that is out of range for a list or other sequence. This can happen when trying to access an element at an index that does not exist.

Example:
```python
# Accessing an index that is out of range
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(my_list[5])  # This will cause an IndexError
```
