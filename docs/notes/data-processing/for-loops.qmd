# List Iteration and Looping

Recall our example list from earlier:


```{python}
symbols = ["MSFT", "AAPL", "GOOGL", "AMZN", "NFLX"]
print(type(symbols))
print(symbols)
```

We saw how we can print and access all items at once. And we saw we can use an index reference to access a specific item. But what if we want to access each item individually, however many there are?

We can use a **\"for\" loop** to access each item one at a time:

```{python}
print("TOP")

for item in symbols:
    print("--------")
    print(item)
    # NOTHING ELSE, GO TO NEXT ITEM

print("BOTTOM")
```

When we use a \"for\" loop, we have to fill in some slots. We have no choice but to put the list we want to loop through in the second slot (after the `in`). But we have an absolute arbitrary choice of what variable name to use to reference each item (after the `for`). Whatever variable name we choose (e.g. `x`), we must also reference that variable within the scope of the loop:

```{python}
print("TOP")

for x in symbols:
    print("--------")
    print(x)
    # NOTHING ELSE, GO TO NEXT ITEM

print("BOTTOM")
```

In practice, if we have a list of items plural (`symbols`), we could call each item the singular version (`symbol`) to make our code readable:

```{python}
print("TOP")

for symbol in symbols:
    print("--------")
    print(symbol)
    # NOTHING ELSE, GO TO NEXT ITEM

print("BOTTOM")
```

Loops are essential and foundational. They will form the basis of more advanced operations, such as [mapping](./mapping.qmd) and [filtering](./filtering.qmd).
