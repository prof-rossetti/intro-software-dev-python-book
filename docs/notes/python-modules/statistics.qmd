# The `statistics` Module

The [`statistics` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/statistics.html) contains statistical related functions, such as measures of central tendency:

```{python}
from statistics import mean, median, mode

my_nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]

print(mean(my_nums))

print(median(my_nums))

print(mode(my_nums))
```
