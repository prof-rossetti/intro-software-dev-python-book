# Table of Contents in Google Colab

The "Table of contents" menu in the Google Colab sidebar shows a document outline, similar to a table of contents you may be familiar with in word processing software.

The heading structure of your markdown cells will govern the document structure displayed in the table of contents. It is helpful to practice your ability to implement a document outline by implementing different [Markdown heading levels](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#headings) in your text cells.


```md
# Header 1

This is some text.

## Header 2

This is some text.

### Heading 3

This is some text.

#### Heading 4

This is some text.
```

::: {.callout-tip title="Note"}
You may need to place each of these headings in its own separate text cell, for the document outline to collapse properly.
