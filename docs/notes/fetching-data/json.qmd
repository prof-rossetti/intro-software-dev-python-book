# Fetching JSON Data

If the data you want to fetch is in JSON format, we can use the [`requests` package](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to fetch and process it.

Let's consider this example \"students.json\" file we have hosted on the Internet:


```json
{
  "downloadDate": "2018-06-05",
  "professorId": 123,
  "students": [
    {"studentId": 1, "finalGrade": 76.7},
    {"studentId": 2, "finalGrade": 85.1},
    {"studentId": 3, "finalGrade": 50.3},
    {"studentId": 4, "finalGrade": 89.8},
    {"studentId": 5, "finalGrade": 97.4},
    {"studentId": 6, "finalGrade": 75.5},
    {"studentId": 7, "finalGrade": 87.2},
    {"studentId": 8, "finalGrade": 88.0},
    {"studentId": 9, "finalGrade": 93.9},
    {"studentId": 10, "finalGrade": 92.5}
  ]
}
```



First we note the URL of where the data resides. Then we pass that as a parameter to the `get` function from the `requests` package, to issue an HTTP GET request:

```{python}
import requests

# the URL of some JSON data we stored online:
request_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prof-rossetti/python-for-finance/main/docs/data/gradebook.json"

response = requests.get(request_url)
print(type(response))
```

We receive a response object from the server. The response object has a few methods and properties we care about. First, the status code tells us if the request was generally successful:

```{python}
response.status_code
```

The `text` property is a string that looks like it could one day be some data:

```{python}
print(type(response.text))
response.text
```

The final step is to convert this JSON-formatted string to actual Python data. We can do this using the `json` method of the response object, or by leveraging the `loads` function from the [`json` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html):


```{python}
data = response.json()
print(type(data))
data
```

```{python}
import json

data = json.loads(response.text)
print(type(data))
data
```

Once we have the data, we can work with it in the ways we know how. For example, looping through a list of dictionaries:

```{python}
students = data["students"]
print(type(students))
len(students)
```

```{python}
for student in students:
    print(student["studentId"], student["finalGrade"])
```

This data happens to be dictionary-like at the top level. However be aware, when we fetch JSON, it can be either list-like, or dictionary-like on the top level. So you must observe the structure of your particular data before processing it further.
